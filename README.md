# Task List Bug

# Challenge Description

You are working on a task management app that displays a list of tasks.
However, there is a bug in the code that makes it impossible to add or remove a task.

Your objective is to identify and fix the bug.

## Requirements

- Clicking the "Add Task" button should add a new task to the list. Fix it.
- Clicking the x on a task should remove that task from the list. Fix it.

## Other Considerations

- If you see the `data-test` attribute anywhere in the boilerplate don't remove it.
- TailwindCSS is preinstalled with the default config. It might be helpful for you, if you want to have some styles. (Not obligatory)
